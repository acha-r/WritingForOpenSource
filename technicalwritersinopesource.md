# Collaborating With Developers: A Technical Writer's Guide in the Open Source World

Open-source projects are licensed projects with their source code available for the public to inspect and modify. The licenses associated with these projects require that anyone who modifies the source code must, in turn, share their changes with the community, allowing other programmers to use and contribute to the project. 
Projects are made open-source deliberately to encourage external input, and adoption and promote openness.

In this article, we'll explore why open-source projects matter to us as technical writers, and how our expertise contributes to its success.


## The Need for Documentation In Open Source Projects
Alongside a license that allows free sharing, all open-source projects have guides for contributors or intending contributors. These guides are otherwise known as documentation. 
Documentation is a significant feature of every open-source project. Its absence can lead to a chaotic and ineffective contribution process. Documentation empowers developers to comprehend the project and make optimal use of its available features. As a result, adoption and collaboration are seamless.

It is not unusual for developers to assume that their code is self-documented, hence they do not have a need for intentional, and extensive documentation. Such an assumption can, unfortunately, spell doom for any application, regardless of how great the solution is.


## Technical Writers In Open Source Projects 
While not all developers may have the skills of technical writers, it's essential to recognize that their primary focus is on software development rather than technical documentation. Therefore, they lay greater emphasis on their coding expertise than on their writing skills. A technical writer's role is to ensure that a project's documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and user-friendly.

To optimize the quality of documentation, collaboration between technical writers and developers is of paramount importance because it creates a synergy of expertise. Developers are needed to provide insights on the technical accuracy of the documentation, while technical writers can offer suggestions for improvements in clarity and user-friendliness.


## How to Effectively Work With Developers as A Technical Writer
Effective collaboration with developers is crucial for technical writers to produce high-quality documentation for open-source software projects. 
Letâ€™s address some strategies to ensure this happens.

- Understand developer workflows and processes: Knowing the development process helps us create documentation corresponding to the various stages of software development. This ensures that our documentation is relevant and valuable to the team.

- Establish working relationships with developers: Often, there's a disconnect between individuals in different units who should collaborate. Minimal interaction can lead to information gaps between technical writers and developers. To bridge this gap, actively participate in meetings and proactively seek their input and feedback.

- Go for clarity: Prioritize comprehension by asking questions, even about basic things. We can't effectively break down technical concepts that need to be understood by a wide audience if we don't genuinely understand these concepts ourselves. 

- Follow a clear outline: We must have an outline that should be shared with the developers. This will guide them to effectively contribute to the documentation and comment on their codes.

- Stay up to date with software: Projects evolve, and our documentation should too. Update when the software changes, and communicate these updates effectively.

- Appreciate feedback and improve where necessary: Establish a feedback loop where developers can provide feedback on the documentation's clarity, accuracy, and usefulness.


## Understanding Developers as Audiences
As technical writers contributing to open-source projects, our primary audience is software developers. Developers turn to documentation when they face challenges or need to learn something for their applications. 
They prefer documentation that is concise and easy to skim. A quick scan allows them to determine if it contains the information they need before diving into a detailed read.
Documentation should be organized logically with a clear table of contents and sub-headings. Navigating through each sections should not be a hassle.

Our choice of words should always be clear, concise, and unambiguous. Maintaining a well-defined style guide is invaluable for ensuring that our content is easy to scan and understand.

Code samples are essential components of most technical documentation. As mentioned earlier, developers sometimes find themselves stuck and don't have the luxury of time to mentally visualize a solution based solely on our descriptions. 
To address this, include well-structured and commented code examples that are directly relevant to the topic. Additionally, it's crucial to keep the code up-to-date and free of errors.

When it comes to implementation code, it should not be an afterthought. We can develop simple programs and extract code samples from them. This approach not only provides a better understanding but also exposes us to more writing points based on our firsthand experience with the features such as common errors/exceptions.


## Getting Started: Tools and Technologies
Technical writing can benefit from a variety of tools and technologies to improve efficiency, collaboration, and the quality of the documentation. Here is a list of some essential tools and technologies for technical writing:

- Markdown Editors: Tools like Visual Studio Code, Typora, or Markdown editors facilitate the creation of plain text documents with simple formatting that can be easily converted to HTML or other formats.
- Documentation Platforms: Platforms like Confluence, Read the Docs, GitHub Pages, or GitBook provide a collaborative environment for hosting and maintaining technical documentation.
- Version Control Systems: Git and platforms like GitHub or GitLab help manage revisions, collaborate with others, and track changes in documentation.
- Project Management Software: Tools like Asana, Trello, or Jira can help manage tasks, deadlines, and collaboration among team members.
- Collaboration Tools: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, or similar platforms are valuable for communication and collaboration within a technical writing team.
Style and Grammar Checkers: Grammarly or ProWritingAid help ensure clear and error-free writing.

The specific tools and technologies we need may vary based on our project, team, and the nature of the documentation we are creating.

In conclusion, technical writers are encouraged to embrace open-source collaboration as it leads to a more inclusive, dynamic, and collectively beneficial environment for both writers and the tech community we serve.
